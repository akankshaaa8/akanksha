                <li>Pushing Docker images to Docker Hub for sharing</li>
                <li>Verifying and deploying your application</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So let's dive in and start building!</p>
        </section>
       
            <section>
                <h2>Part 1: Setting Up the Project</h2>
                <p>In this initial phase of our journey, we've already set up the foundation for our three-tier application. We began by selecting a suitable project to work with, which served as the basis for our modifications and enhancements.</p>
                <p>For this tutorial, we chose a project named "Amazona: E-commerce for Men's Clothes." However, we've already transformed it into a new and exciting venture called "Brown Wood: Home & Office Furniture E-Commerce Website."</p>
                <p>This transformation involved significant changes to the project's design, functionality, and overall theme. We rebranded the user interface, introduced new features tailored to the home and office furniture market, and refined the user experience to align with our vision.</p>
                <p>Throughout this process, we leveraged our creativity and expertise to mold the project into a unique and compelling offering that caters to the needs and preferences of our target audience. By infusing our personal touch into the project, we breathed new life into it and set the stage for a remarkable journey ahead.</p>
                <p>So let's roll up our sleeves, unleash our creativity, and embark on this exhilarating adventure with "Brown Wood"!</p>
            
            
            </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Part 2: Understanding the Project Structure</h2>
            <p>After customizing the project, we structured it into three main directories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>backend</code>: Contains the Node.js backend code.</li>
                <li><code>frontend</code>: Contains the React frontend code.</li>
                <li><code>docker-compose.yml</code>: Defines the multi-container setup for our Docker environment.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Part 3: Writing Dockerfiles</h2>
            <h3>Backend Dockerfile</h3>
            <p>The Dockerfile for the backend service:</p>
            <pre><code>FROM node:alpine
                        WORKDIR /app/backend
                        COPY package*.json ./
                        RUN npm install
                        COPY . .
                        EXPOSE 5000
                        CMD ["npm", "start"]</code></pre>
            <h3>Frontend Dockerfile</h3>
            <p>The Dockerfile for the frontend service:</p>
            <pre><code>FROM node:alpine
                        WORKDIR /app/frontend
                        COPY package*.json ./
                        RUN npm install
                        COPY . .
                        EXPOSE 3000
                        CMD ["npm", "start"]</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Part 4: Creating Docker Containers</h2>
            <p>Before we define the Docker Compose file, let's create Docker containers for each service:</p>
            <pre><code>docker build -t backend-image ./backend</code></pre>
            <pre><code>docker build -t frontend-image ./frontend</code></pre>
            <p>Replace <code>backend-image</code> and <code>frontend-image</code> with the desired names for your Docker images.</p>
            <img src="Screenshot 2024-04-23 232508.png" alt="Containers">
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Part 5: Creating Docker Compose File</h2>
            <p>Now that we have our Docker containers, let's define the Docker Compose file to manage them:</p>
            <pre><code>version: '3'
                    services:
                    backend:
                        image: backend-image
                        ports:
                        - "5000:5000"
                        depends_on:
                        - mongodb
                    frontend:
                        image: frontend-image
                        ports:
                        - "3000:3000"
                        depends_on:
                        - backend
                    mongodb:
                        image: mongo
                        ports:
                        - "27017:27017"</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Part 6: Building and Running the Application</h2>
            <p>Let's build and run our application:</p>
            <pre><code>docker-compose up --build</code></pre>
            <p>After running the command, Docker will start building the images and containers for our three-tier application.</p>

            <img src="Screenshot 2024-04-23 135012.png" alt="database">
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Part 7: Pushing Images to Docker Hub</h2>
            <p>Once the Docker build process completes, we need to push our Docker images to Docker Hub to make them accessible to others:</p>
            <pre><code>docker login</code></pre>
            <pre><code>docker tag &lt;image_id&gt; username/repository:tag</code></pre>
            <pre><code>docker push username/repository:tag</code></pre>
            <p><code>docker akankshaaa8</code> <code>21bcp281</code> <code>latest:</code><code>1a56ae5c4174</code> </p>
            <img src="Screenshot 2024-04-24 004116.png" alt="dockerhub images">
            <img src="Screenshot 2024-04-23 134917.png" alt="images">
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Part 8: Verification</h2>
            <p>After pushing the images to Docker Hub, others can pull and run them. You can also verify the images on Docker Hub by visiting your repository's page.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Through this tutorial, we've transformed a pre-existing project into a new one tailored to our needs. By understanding the project structure, writing Dockerfiles, creating Docker containers, and defining a Docker Compose file, we've successfully built, deployed, and shared our three-tier application using Docker. This approach enables us to create scalable and maintainable applications with ease.</p>
